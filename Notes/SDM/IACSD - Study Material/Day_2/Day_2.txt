Agile Methodology:
	
	Software Developent Process
		
	Phases:
			Requirement gathering
			Planning
			Analysis & Design
			Development
			Testing
			Deployment
			Maintainance
	
	0. Waterfall Model
		Requirement gathering---- SRS------ Locked
		 Planning---Plan----Locked
		  Analysis---Design---Locked
		    Development-- Build ( compiled code)--- Locked
			Testing-----test cases  Unit testing
				 ---run tests against compiled code----results are share back to Dev.       				  Goahead
			 Deployemnt:deploy bindary of your solution to customer enviornment
		          Maintainance: Customer Support for ongoing application modification.
	Rule:
	80%-------20 %
	
	100 softwares  featuresare developed using Waterfall model--------- budget, manpower, time , resources
	80 softwares feartures are not used ----------------------------------budget, manpower, time , 										resources
	20 software are used under manintainance Mode------------------budget, manpower, time , 						resources

	 ViveK:
		then what is the use of waterfall model?? where we can use it efficiently??

	Pros and cons of Waterfall Model
		Pros: one time work
		      step by step process
		      Less time for delivery	
		cons:
		      not possbile to accept new changes
		      No reverse 
		      not suitable for Online Applications
		      very difficult to modify,  


	DFA: Data First Approach
	CFA: Code First Approach 
	EFA: Entity First Approach
	TDD: Test Driven Development---

			First  Requirements are gathers
			second Quality plan is defined
			third   QA Team will design Test cases
			Fourth  Testing Team will build unit test, test cases
			fitfh   Testing Enviornment is prepared 
			sixth   Wait for Software Develpment to provide Soulution
			Seventh	Now using Mannual testing or Automation Test the solution Given by Development Team
			Eight	: Certify the product

	1.Spiral Model Impementation:
		:	Step by Step execution
		
	 Todays bussinesses are depend on customers expectations
	 their bussiness applications should accomodate changes expected to deliver service to end users.
	 Application need to flexible:
		Applications can be extended with new features
		Application existing features can be deprecated or updated.
	 Application need to be agile
	 Agility:
		fast moving
		 (Dynamic)
		   More adaptive  to changes expected:
