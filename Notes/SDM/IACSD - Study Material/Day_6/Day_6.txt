	Good morning all of you

	How are you ?
	
	Getting ready for learning new things ?

	Cloud Ready Applications....
	
		Microservices--------
		Loosely coupled applications but highly cohesive in execution.

	Fresh start....
		Every day is a new experience....


	Can we slightly revise techical words .....?
	
	Data: Information
	Application: Core operations to process data, show data
					analysis of data
	Source Code:
		    Code to build application
	Build Process:
		    compilation, linking, building 

	Day 6:
		Cloud Ready Applications
			Cloud apps
				Google Apps
				Office 365,
				
			using Microservices
			 Loosely coupled , Highly cohesive functionalities
			
			Inside Containers
			
			Container Orchestration Platform  (PAAS)
				Azure Container Service
				Amazon Conttainer Service
				Kuberneties
				(Cloud Providers  PAAS)
					Google, Amazon, Microsoft
			Container Images, Container instances, Container execution
				Container Exeuction Engine
					Open Source Engine : Docker
			
	Is it possible for us to build our Business Application Using Microservices ?
	Would it be possible to develop these application artifects
				Using Web Apps, Mobile Apps, REST API, Application Services ?

Recap:
	Handson--- (Production Enviornment)

		1.Create a simple Web Application.
				Node JS HTTP server application
				index.html------static/
						dynamic page  ( javascript file, Angular , jQuery, ReactJS)
				server.js, 
					source code for 
					   hosting and listening HTTP server on port no.
				 	   used Node Modules
						  fs   module-----dependencies
						  http module
						  url  module
	       2.Run Node JS Application using Node command
				
				node server.js   -------------Node JS Runtime
		   Node process is created inside Linux OS 


		3.EC2 instance  in which   containing this enviornment using Linux server 
			need to be configured with Security settings using Security Group
		4.Set incomming rule or outgoing rule
			by allowing and denying incomming request or outgoing reponses using firewall setting
		5.Allow your Customers ( End users) to access web application using URL.
			published URL
			http://234.65.343.34:8081/index.html
		6.We used Infrastructure As A Service provided by AWS with the help of  EC2 Cloud service.

		7.If your virtual server hosted in AWS EC2 Service,
				It would process incomming HTTP request from End Users.
				To process that request , 
					Virtual server would demand  CPU, RAM, Networking, storage from AWS ec2 Service
				EC2 service of AWS keep monitoring  CPU utilization
								    RAM utilization
								    Network utilization
								    Storage Utilization
				based on this Billing is going to be set for subscriber
						Transflower-------
								no.hours virtual server running
