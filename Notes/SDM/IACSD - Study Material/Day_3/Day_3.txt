	Cloud Ready Applications:

	 Cloud------------Hosting Enviornment-------- Hardware
			  Hardware:--> ol
			  Computation:--> Processor + RAM + ROM
			  Processor:-->	 CPU + GPU

	 Application------Online Application----------Software
	
	 Application: 

	 Desktop Application-------mspaint, notepad, Visual studio, eclipse
					 (Native Application)
					 (stand alone application)
					  data + application executable--- exe, txt
					  Console Application	    ( CUI)
					  Windwos Based Application ( GUI)
					  hosted on Single Operating System
					  accessed by one user at a time
					  Single User Application

					  Process--- exe code + data
  

       Distributed Application----
			Multiuser Application

	 based on Client Server Model

	Physical Infrastructure at data center

			
	Enduser1--machine------( Client Application Thin client)----  -------Networking-- 	Server Machine
							  					(Server Application)
							  						logic + data
	Enduser2--machine------ (Client Application Thin client)----
	Enduser3--machine------ (Client Application Thin client)----
	Enduser4--machine------ (Client Application Thin client)---- RPC--
								     Socket Programming
								     TCP
								     UDP 

	Enduser5--machine------ (Client Application Thin client)----
	Enduser6--machine------ (Client Application Thin client)----



	In distributed Enviornment:
		

	End user invoke :

	Client Application
		(could be browser)
		(dedicated windows application) to talk to server
		(postman)

	( there might be custom java application )---communicating other server application

	Client application sends a request--------channelised through Network--- 
						  ( TCP/IP)---state full protocol-- bandwidth consumed more
						  ( HTTP)-----state less protocol-- efficient bandwidth used

		-->Server application receives a request and process request
				   sends response to remote client who initiated request

	IPC--> Inter Process Communication
			two applications installed on same machine
			and they are exchanging information
			process1--- IPC---process2
			
	RPC--> Remote Procedural Call
		( RMI)

	Online Application are always Centralized internet application:

	Centralized Application with data processing accessed via Rich Web Client ( browser chrome, Edge, firefox,safari,,,,etc)

	Client--->browser
	Client--->Postman
	Client Application----> some another technology Application
	Server Application
	
	Server-- scalable computation + high Storage + high Speed network
	Companies Data Center
		Server Room:
			Multiple Racks:
				Rack Server:-----
					Blade Server------
							Linux based servers/
							Windows servers
        (  Transflower Cluster)

	1.machine----- 16 GB RAM + i7 (8 core)
	2.machine----- 16 GB RAM + i7
	3.machine----- 16 GB RAM + i7
	4.machine----- 16 GB RAM + i7
	5.machine----- 16 GB RAM + i7
	6.machine----- 16 GB RAM + i7
	7.machine----- 16 GB RAM + i7
	8.machine----- 16 GB RAM + i7
	9.machine----- 16 GB RAM + i7

	 80 GB  RAM +  40 core processors  ( Distributed Computational Resources)

	connected using networking--- fiber optics cable

	Now deploy your  Web Applcation on Multiserver infrastructure

	Online Application: (Software)
		Complete functionality of Application have been distributed on different  servers

		 mores Webservers  + more than Application Server + 
			    database cluster (no of dabase servers)+
			    			high storage back servers

------------------

		Notepad Application	 (Gangu Teli)-----desktop application ( windows appln)
					exe + txt

		Online shopping Application   (Raja Bhoj)-

	
		Webbased application ( Full stack Application)

			----->	Web site + Web services+
					 + dedicate Application services+
					 + database  in the form of  tera bytes, peta bytes


			Web site--- WEB PAGES:
					  static web pages  (html) home, about us, contact us, services 
						
					  dynamice web pages
							JSP + servelet
 								
							( Single html + javascript framework SPA)
							      ( SPA)--
							      Angular Application:
								( muiltiple components----- html, ts,. spec.,
								  mulitole directives,
								  mulitple services, (injectable services---- consume rest api)
								  Router,,,,,etc.)
				    state management technique
							session , cache
				    Security
							Authentication, Authorization
				    Personalization
							User profile management
				    Multilingual Support
							localization ( Internationalization)

				    Responsive UI Rendering
							Bootstrap

			
				Web services--

				    REST API ( Spring Boot Api)
				    CRUD REST API

			Dedicate Application services---

					indexing ( sorting,  Bussiness Queries)
					social media , Trending logic--(likes, comments, hashtag)
					Business Logic----(Core Java logic----pojo, collection framework, actual logic )
					Data Access Logic-- (DAO)----( hibernate, JPA, JDBC)
					Transaction management
					Reliable Queueing mechanism

		       External Data Access services---
					 accesssing database data
					 accessing streaming data
					 accessing other web services-----------payment gateway
		       
			Inhouse database management System
					 Oracle Cluster
							RDBMS database
					 Non SQL Database
							MongoDB database 
					 Media servers
							images, documents,
							video files



		SOA (Service Oriented Architecture):
		
			Architecture which is used for designing  complete Solution in the form of 
				Reusable Web services
				
				SpringBoot API

				Authetication Service   http://124.23.54.34/api/authservice urls----Web app----bll--dao---d/b
							CRUD operations
				mumbai datacenter

				Catalog Service		http://124.23.54.34/api/catalogservice----Web app----bll--dao---d/b
							CRUD operations
				chennai datacenter

				Shopping Cart Service	http://124.23.54.34/api/cartservice----Web app----bll--dao---d/b
							CRUD operations

				Delhi datacenter
